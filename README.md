# Description of My Project
This project is my take on a keyboad; it is orthognal, low profile keyboard with fancy knobs (cause who doesn't like knobs).
The reason I made this project is beacuse I have never loved the keyboard I have had for years now, and I have always wanted to try an orthongnal keyboard. This keyboard is based on the creator keyboard by work louder but I am not paying $350 for a keyboard when I can just build one!
