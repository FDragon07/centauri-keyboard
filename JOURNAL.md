The start of a new project, a custom built keyboard down to the PCB.

I Watched [this video](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=mTEns_m9Yz2wHLTt) last night for anticipation of this project. I found it interesting but this video shows you how to build a keyboard but does not explain how it works. It is a good video if you just want to build your own keyboard but I want to understand the nitty gritty of how a keyboard works.

I have thought about what I want this keyboard to look like, here is an image I drew up:

This was a lot of fun to draw up, figuring out where everything should go. There are definitely unconventional parts of this layout going on, like the backslash is in a weird corner but the perk of building my own keyboard is I can change the layout when ever I want (so I can change it down the line). To help with that this keyboard is going to be mechanical. 

Since this keyboard does not have a keypad (would just look ugly) on it I feel like I should have another module that is a keypad because I do use it a lot on my current keyboard. I did not create a layout for that but I am thinking just a simple 4x5 size grid.

#### Layout Explanation
This is a Colemak keyboard layout for the letters but I moved around symbols. I first moved the parentheses down and without a shift since I use them so much, this was kinda my whole notion for the layout is the more I used it the closer it was to the home row. The one thing I do not like about this layout is the size of the backspace button.

The knobs and buttons in the top right corner are going to be programmable so I can change what they do. Kinda like the stream deck with their button and knobs. Lastly there is also a tiny screen I added, that is in the same vein as before.

**Time Spent: 2.5 hours**

Still on the layout today, I fixed some of the issues that were found. First, there was no '/?' key or '`~' key to fix this I added another collum to the keyboard. Second was the backspace button felt too small to me so I made it bigger. Also when it comes to the backspace I will be using "function" + "backspace" to use it as a delete key. This also goes for all the F1-10, for F11 and F12 I do not know what I am going to do yet. Lastly there is still that weird extra keys next to the arrow keys that I do not know what I am going to do with (maybe make it an F11, 12 key but that just seems weird).

Here is the image for the updated design:

### PCB
This is my first time creating a PCB, so all I have done so far is reseach. I decide to pick KiCad as my software of choice for no real reason besides that it is free and was the first thing that popped up when I looked up 'how to start making a PCB.' I also started the tutorial they have in their docs for beginners. [Here is the link](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html) to the tutorial. I only got through the schematic:
