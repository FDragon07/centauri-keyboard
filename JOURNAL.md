The start of a new project, a custom built keyboard down to the PCB.

I Watched [this video](https://youtu.be/7UXsD7nSfDY?si=mTEns_m9Yz2wHLTt) last night for anticipation of this project. I found it interesting but this video shows you how to build a keyboard but does not explain how it works. It is a good video if you just want to build your own keyboard but I want to understand the nitty gritty of how a keyboard works.

I have thought about what I want this keyboard to look like, here is an image I drew up:

This was a lot of fun to draw up, figuring out where everything should go. There are definitely unconventional parts of this layout going on, like the backslash is in a weird corner but the perk of building my own keyboard is I can change the layout when ever I want (so I can change it down the line). To help with that this keyboard is going to be mechanical. 

Since this keyboard does not have a keypad (would just look ugly) on it I feel like I should have another module that is a keypad because I do use it a lot on my current keyboard. I did not create a layout for that but I am thinking just a simple 4x5 size grid.

#### Layout Explanation
This is a Colemak keyboard layout for the letters but I moved around symbols. I first moved the parentheses down and without a shift since I use them so much, this was kinda my whole notion for the layout is the more I used it the closer it was to the home row. The one thing I do not like about this layout is the size of the backspace button.

The knobs and buttons in the top right corner are going to be programmable so I can change what they do. Kinda like the stream deck with their button and knobs. Lastly there is also a tiny screen I added, that is in the same vein as before.
